R as GIS
========

How to use R for maps and GIS.

In data you will have: Some data of mammals from Volcan Barva in Costa Rica, a shape file (vector) of forest from Volcan Barva, and some ascii (raster) of topographic variables from Volcan Barva.  

Please unzip the data files in the same directory of the code.

Have fun making maps in R!
